Using the IN Mode
An IN parameter lets you pass values to the subprogram being called. Inside the subprogram, an IN parameter acts like a constant. Therefore, it cannot be assigned a value.

Using the OUT Mode
An OUT parameter lets you return values to the caller of a subprogram. Inside the subprogram, an OUT parameter acts like a variable. 
That means you can use an OUT formal parameter as if it were a local variable

Using the IN OUT Mode
An IN OUT parameter lets you pass initial values to the subprogram being called and return updated values to the caller. Inside the subprogram, an IN OUT parameter acts like an initialized variable. Therefore, it can be assigned a value and its value can be assigned to another variable.

The actual parameter that corresponds to an IN OUT formal parameter must be a variable; it cannot be a constant or an expression.
